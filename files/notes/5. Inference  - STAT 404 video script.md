Module 5: Statistical Modeling (SM) II: Inference

Learning objectives: 
In addition to producing more realistic results, Probabilistic Models allow inverse problems to be tackled: using the data and a model structure, parameters can be inferred through a suitable algorithm, i.e. what are the parameter values that most likely produced the observed data, or the most likely p(\theta|Y). That is statistical inference, or simply inference, and it's what brings together data generation/collection (or alternatively, in a controlled setting, experimental design), the data itself, and statistical models.


Statistical Inference takes the guesswork out of finding parameter values and brings in formal methods to identify the parameters that give the best fit to the data, this requires flipping the perspective from the output space to the parameter space by setting up models where the parameters are free to be explored and the data is fixed from what's observed. We will do taht exercise, and by the end of this module you should be able to:

Module-level objectives:
1. Recognize inference as the inverse of computation/simulation
2. Formulate simple inference problems
