Welcome to the webpage for Single Variable Calculus a one-semester course. This course begins with a brief [review of pre-calculus](http://naivestoked.github.io/files/diagnostic_tests.pdf) topics like [algebra](https://stewartcalculus.com/data/BIOCALCULUS_CPS/upfiles/bio_reviewofalgebra.pdf),<!-- https://stewartcalculus.com/data/CALCULUS_8E/upfiles/6e_reviewofalgebra.pdf --> [analytic geometry](https://stewartcalculus.com/data/BIOCALCULUS_CPS/upfiles/bio_reviewofanalgeom.pdf)  <!-- https://stewartcalculus.com/data/CALCULUS_8E/upfiles/6e_reviewofanalgeom.pdf-->, and [trigonometric functions](http://naivestoked.github.io/files/calculus_reviewoftrig.pdf); students who come from less quantitative backgrounds or think they would benefit from a refresher in precalculus are encouraged to pick up a free digital version of [APEX Pre-calculus](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12b2cwH7afXhsYSDb-QCWKmFK2QCq7UfY), glance over an online pre-calculus course (such as [Khan Academy's](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) or [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/precalculus) before or at the beginning of the course, and ask for instructor's feedback on their problem-solving skills. This will allow each student to gauge their specific needs, and make sure all students are up to speed by the first few lectures.

The course then enters the territory of classic "Calculus I", as offered in many parts of the world to students who do not have previous exposure to the topic. It starts from single-variable functions [ i.e. \\(y =f(x) \\) ] to define concepts related to the infinite and infinitesimal, like limits when variables tend to zero or infinity, instantaneous rates of change (derivatives), and areas under a curve (integrals).
These ideas appear often in nature, and these examples will be used to motivate and conceptualize core concepts in calculus.

A textbook covering the standard topics of single variable calculus is required for this course. The adopted textbook is [APEX Calculus](http://www.apexcalculus.com/), which is an open textbook with a free digital version and [affordable hard copies](http://www.apexcalculus.com/purchase). The Calculus I sequence is quite standard, so any calculus book may be used as long as it covers all topics in the syllabus.
[Biocalculus](https://www.cengage.com/c/biocalculus-calculus-probability-and-statistics-for-the-life-sciences-1e-stewart/9781305114036/) by James Stewart and Troy Day and [Calculus](https://www.cengage.com/c/calculus-8e-stewart/) by James Stewart have been used in previous semesters - any edition of the latter, from the 6th on, will cover the topics in this course (earlier editions probably do as well, but I haven't checked).
