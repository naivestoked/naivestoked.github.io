Module 6. Machine Learning (ML): Statistical Modeling meets Big Data

Learning objectives:
Machine Learning is around 70 years old and has lived under the shadow of its older sibling, Statistical Modeling for most of its life; however, with the exponential increase in computing power and more-than-exponential increase in available data, it has srpung to the forefront and overshadowed the then-dominant relative. Or has it? 

Module-level objectives:

In this module we will see what are the defining features of ML, and what are straightforward extensions of Statistical Modeling, what are differences in practice and application of the same tools. By the end of this module you should be able to:
1. Recognize the differences in Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning
2. Describe the process of training and testing a model
